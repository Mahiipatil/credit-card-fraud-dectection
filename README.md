# Credit Card fraud dectection using Machine learning
# About the Project
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. With the rise of digital payments, fraud detection has become a critical challenge for financial institutions. Traditional rule-based methods often fail to adapt to new fraud patterns, making machine learning an effective solution.
In this project, we leverage various supervised learning algorithms to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate based on historical transaction data. The dataset contains features extracted from real-world credit card transactions, allowing us to train, evaluate, and deploy a predictive model that enhances fraud detection accuracy.
 # Purpose of the Project
Enhance Fraud Detection Accuracy: Utilize machine learning models to improve fraud detection rates while minimizing false positives.

Real-time Detection: Develop an efficient model that can detect fraudulent transactions in real-time.

Data-driven Decision Making: Use advanced data analytics techniques to uncover hidden patterns in fraudulent transactions.

Reduce Financial Losses: Help financial institutions and businesses mitigate losses due to fraudulent activities.

Compare Machine Learning Models: Evaluate different machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, to determine the most effective model for fraud detection.
